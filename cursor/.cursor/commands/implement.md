# /implement

Execute the approved plan with strict TDD.

Target: the feature ID I give after this command, or the single non-DONE feature claimed in `context/ACTIVE.json`. If several are unfinished and I did not name an id, list them and stop.

Follow `.cursor/skills/tdd-loop/SKILL.md`. Refuse to start unless `status.json` gate hashes still match the spec and plan. Run tasks strictly one at a time (ignore `[P]`). Each `tdd-implementer` brief is only that task, its test-case rows, `structure.md`, and the single-test command. Record one-line task evidence from the tool result. Do not re-run a command already in the turn, and do not run the full suite until every task is checked. Then continue automatically into `code-review`.
